# Apache Camel for Eclipse

This is a preview release of the Eclipse plugin that adds [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) language support for XML DSL and Java DSL code.
  
# Features

After you add this extension to your Eclipse IDE installation, when you use the generic Eclipse text editor, you can access the following Apache Camel language service features for Apache Camel URIs (both XML DSL and Java DSL):

   * Auto-completion for Camel components, attributes, and the list of attribute values
  
   * Quick reference documentation when you hover the cursor over a Camel component
   
When you use the XML or Java editor, only the auto-completion feature is provided.

For detailed information about Apache Camel supported features, see the [Language Server GitHub page](https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-language-server#features).

# Before you begin

* Install the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).

  Optionally, you can install this plugin on top of an Eclipse IDE installation with Red Hat CodeReady Studio and [Fuse Tooling](https://tools.jboss.org/features/fusetools.html). This **Apache Camel for Eclipse** plugin provides even more help for Fuse development.
