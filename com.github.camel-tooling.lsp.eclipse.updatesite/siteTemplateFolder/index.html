                <h4>Stable Releases</h4>
                Stable releases are - as indicated by their name - stable.<br/>
                You can also install the latest stable release by using the below install button. Just drag it to an open Eclipse instance.<br/>
                <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4038733" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client"><img typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" src="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client" /></a>

		<h4>Continuous Integration (CI) Builds</h4>
                The bleeding edge contains the latest and greatest new features, but nothing is
                stable or guaranteed - yet. If you're using a Release and need a fix, you can update to the latest CI, or wait for the next release.<br/>
